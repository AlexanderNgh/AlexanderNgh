Hi! My name is Alexander Pham, and I am currently a sophomore college student studying, you guessed it, computer science. I am really interested in software development,
and producing applications. My favorite projects this semester were in C# and .NET Winforms. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and overall front end as I continue
with my studies in univesity. I am looking to collaborate on bigger scale projects! 

If you want to reach me, email me at alexanderncpham@gmail.com
